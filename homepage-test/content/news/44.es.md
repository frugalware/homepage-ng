      It was a trouble for several users to upgrade the old nvidia package (locally-compiled at install) to the new, binary one. Here is the solution (provided that the database and the other packages are up-to-date):<br />
            <pre>pacman -Sfd nvidia --noconfirm</pre>
            (No, it does not mean that we dislike the Software Freedom Day...)
