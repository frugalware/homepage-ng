      If you are upgrading current or to current any time soon, you
      will need to take special measures. We have switched our stock
      kernel to using an initrd by default now, but this only effects
      i686 and x86_64 for now. All other archs are unchanged. If you
      are running a fairly simple grub setup, you only need to run
      grubconfig after the complete upgrade. If not, then you need to
      add this line to your Frugalware menu entry in menu.lst. Here it
      is:<br /><br />

      initrd (frugalware grub partition)/boot/initrd.img.xz<br /><br />

      If you encounter problems with the new kernel, please file a
      bug report. But before you do, check if your root partition is
      /dev/sd* and not /dev/hd*. Try converting the /dev/hd* to /dev/sd*
      if you are having trouble.
