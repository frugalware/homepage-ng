            Amazingly, in the time since our homepage upgrade, we've only had 1 bug report to do with the packages section. So now we can work on adding a few improvements. I've just written a kind of robot that automatically posts all news posts from the site to the Frugalware-announce mailing list. It works thanks to darcs post-hooks, so that whenever we push a change to the homepage darcs repository, the post-hook is run to check for new news posts. Don't forget, if you do find a bug remember to post it on our Bug Tracker.<br />
