        Our live-cd will be back soon since Baste has taken over as maintainer of the project Fwlive. Some ISO images are available <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/baste/livecd/">here</a>.
    We are looking for testers. These ISO images are still beta and only in English and French. Please report bugs, feedback and requests to Baste on #frugalware IRC channel or the <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org">Bug Tracker System</a>.
