      <a href="http://planet.frugalware.org">Frugalware's planet</a> - the web
      site which aggregates content from blogs - has moved from planetplanet
      software to bilboplanet. There were some issues with planetplanet and,
      after discussion amongst the development team, the change was done by
      Frugalware developer Devil505.<br /><br />
      The rules state that only posts which are likely to be of interest to
      Frugalware's users are to be included, so if you subscribe you can enjoy
      reading about the laughter and tears, hopes and fears, successes and
      failures which make the community so exciting. Of course if have a blog,
      please consider adding it to the planet. To do this, go to the planet's
      home page and complete the subscription form.
