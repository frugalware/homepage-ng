      Xorg upgrades have been merged to current. There is some manual intervention<br/>
      required due to strict version depends. You will need to remove some packages<br/>
      by force before you can complete your next system upgrade. This command should<br/>
      assist you in this:</br>
      </br>
      pacman-g2 -Rd ffmpeg-compiletime ffmpeg-0.6 ffmpeg-0.6-compiletime</br>
