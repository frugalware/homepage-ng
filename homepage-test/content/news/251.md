      We have removed the 10-evdev.conf file from the xorg-server package. This means when you upgrade, your XKB keyboard layout will no longer work. This is necessary to transition us closer to what systemd does for this. To fix your system, please refer <a href="/docs/upgrade.html">here</a>.<br/>
