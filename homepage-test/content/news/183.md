          The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to <a href="/news/182">announce</a> the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.3, our thirteenth stable release.<br />
          No new features have been added since 1.3rc2, but 94 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.1 in no particular order:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Updated packages: Linux kernel 2.6.35, Xorg server 1.8, GNOME 2.30, KDE 4.4.5 to name a few major components.</li>
            <li>For the first time in the history of Frugalware Linux, we're offering an official graphical netinstall image, search for the "-gui" suffix on the ftp mirrors.</li>
            <li>This time we've verified that no workaround is needed to install this release in VMware and because of this, the relevant note is removed from the documentation.</li>
            <li>The monolithic configuration of XOrg is now split to the <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/Server18Branch">xorg.conf.d directory</a>. You can still use the monolithic config, but the config files in the new directory have priority. XOrg now also uses udev to detect your hardware automatically, /etc/X11/xorg.conf is no longer generated by default.</li>
            <li>Updated image libraries: <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/libjpeg/releases/314766">libjpeg 8</a> and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/libpng/releases/312969">libpng 1.4</a>. While adding support for these new libraries, we touched 1500+ packages, doing various minor fixes and improvements <a href="http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=frugalware-current.git;a=commit;h=33a8f8c592de7fa5881d6cd3a2ecb04663420545">here and there</a>.</li>
          </ul>
