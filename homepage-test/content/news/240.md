      The systemd 188 merge has left a few packages that must be manually removed before<br/>
      a successful system upgrade can be performed. This command should help you if you<br/>
      are encountering this problem in current:<br/>
      <br/>
      pacman-g2 -R systemd-gtk systemd-plymouth dracut-plymouth plymouth plymouth-theme-frugalware plymouth-theme-glow plymouth-theme-solar plymouth-theme-spinfinity<br/>
      <br/>
      After this command you can upgrade by proceeding as you would normally. Thank you.<br/>
