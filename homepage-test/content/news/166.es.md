        With the release of Locris, the support for Getorin is discontinued. It is highly recommended to upgrade to our new stable release, as there will be no more security and bug fixes for Getorin.<br />
        We have released FSA617 to FSA636 for Getorin. That means 20 security problems were issued in half a year.<br />
        If you update to Locris, it will also fix the following vulnerability:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/4054">#4054 - firefox</a></li>
        </ul>
