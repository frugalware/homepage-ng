      The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to <a href="/news/225">announce</a> the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.6, our sixteenth stable release.<br />
      No new features have been added since 1.6rc2, but 93 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.5 in no particular order:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>Updated packages: Linux kernel 3.1.10, XOrg server 1.11.2, GNOME 3.2, KDE SC 4.7, LibreOffice 3.4.5.2, Mozilla Firefox 10.0 to name a few major components.</li>
        <li>i686 and x86_64 ISOs are now hybrid. We no longer build separate USB images for these arches.</li>
        <li>cpupower can be used to configure your CPU power management, and is now our recommended method for doing so.</li>
        <li>UEFI/EFI support has been removed from i686. This is because it is rare on i686.</li>
        <li>UUIDs are now used by the installer when generating the /etc/fstab for new installs.</li>
        <li>fw32, which maintains an i686 chroot on x86_64, is now more mature and usable. If you find it lacking, make a request.</li>
        <li>HAL has been deprecated in favor of udisks</li>
        <li>i686 and x86_64 now use an initrd. See installation documentation for instructions on how to properly upgrade this.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon desktop is included now.</li>
        <li>fwlive is more mature and usable now.</li>
      </ul>
