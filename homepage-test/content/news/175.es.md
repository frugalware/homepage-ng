      were received and it's now up to <strong>you</strong> to vote for your

      but also used as the basis for other themes, including GDM/KDM/SLiM
      themes.  Voting closes at midnight on 17 July 2010 (French local time), so
      please do vote because it's a great opportunity to influence the look and
