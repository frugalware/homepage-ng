            We've upgraded to DBUS 0.9x in -current, meaning that some apps will be broken. We currently don't want any reports on any broken apps so that we don't get flooded by bug reports!
            We have a very big list of things that need rebuilding, so we'll probably cover most apps over this week. We'll post a note when we want your bug reports again!<br /><br />
            Thanks!
