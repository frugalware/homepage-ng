                        As of kernel-2.6.22-6 in Frugalware-current, Intel users will have /dev/sd* devices rather than /dev/hd* ones. The reason is the following: It was not possible to boot the kernel on some machines without this change. See <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/2243">this bugreport</a> for more details. So after upgrading using pacman -Syu, you need to:
                        <ol>
                                        <li>Check if you have an Intel IDE controller using sudo lspci |grep -i intel.*ide. If you got no result then probably you're not affected.</li>
                                        <li>Edit /etc/fstab: change all occurrences of /dev/hd to /dev/sd.</li>
                                        <li>Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst: change all occurrences of /dev/hd to /dev/sd in the Frugalware entry.</li>
                                        <li>Reboot.</li>
                        </ol>
                        Thanks for your understanding!
