        With the release of Anacreon, the support for Solaria is discontinued. It is highly recommended to upgrade to our new stable release, as there will be no more security and bug fixes for Solaria.<br />
        We have released FSA526 to FSA588 for Solaria. That means 63 security problems were issued in half a year.<br />
        If you update to Anacreon, it will also fix the following vulnerability:<br />
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/3179">#3179 - nasm</a></li>
        </ul>
