            The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to <a href="/news/123">announce</a> the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.0pre2, the second technical preview of the upcoming 1.0 stable release.<br />
            A short and incomplete list of changes since 1.0pre1:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Improvements:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Setup: support for having /boot on a RAID1 device, improved support for detecting network card names.</li>
                                        <li>Serial ports are now owned by the 'dialout' (instead of 'uucp') group, as a consensus with other distributions.</li>
                                        <li>For virtualbox users who had to download the whole (~10MB) package again and again after each kernel update - it's a good news that now the kernel module is a separate package to stop wasting bandwidth and time.</li>
                                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Package updates:

                        <b>IMPORTANT</b>: After publishing the installer images, it was noticed that the 'syslog' service fails to start.
