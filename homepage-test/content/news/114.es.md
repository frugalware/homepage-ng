            If you follow the nVidia news, you probably know that there is a new legacy driver. Basically all the support for the FX cards is dropped in the mainline package and is left in a new legacy package.<br />
            The new legacy driver is now available as nvidia-173xx, and the latest nvidia package is also available. So please check your card status and update to the nvidia-173xx package if needed before reporting that X doesn't start anymore.<br />
            Also note that the nVidia packages use a new general build script, so report any breakage not related to the previous issue.<br />
            And to conclude, for those who have some old nVidia hardware, should now be happy to know that the nvidia-71xx legacy package is now available.<br />
