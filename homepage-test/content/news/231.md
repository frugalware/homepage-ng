      This architecture has been removed and will no longer be supported. We lost our buildserver for it and no longer<br/>
      possess the means to support it, as no developers are left to care for it as well. So, powerpc is being powered down.<br/>
      If you possess such hardware, we are sorry, but there is no other choice for us. x86/x86_64 support will continue to be<br/>
      supported indefinitely, as they are much easier to support. Please join us there if you can.<br/>
