            </p><div align="justify">Two arcticles are published about Frugalware Linux. The first is an interview on <a href="http://www.jox.hu">jox.hu</a>, a hungarian IT page. The article is available from <a href="http://www.jox.hu/cikk/?id=141&amp;r=12">here</a> (only in Hungarian). The second is on <a href="http://distrowatch.com">Distrowatch.com</a>. The Distrowatch staff chose the Frugalware Linux to the "Featured distribution of the week". They spent some time to install and evaluate other, well-known Linux distributions and decided to give our distro that title. You can read this article <a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20050509#fdow">here</a>.<br />
