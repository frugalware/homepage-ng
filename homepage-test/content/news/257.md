      This is the second release candidate for Frugalware 1.9.<br/>
      <br/>
      This release fixes a number of minor issues with the installer.<br/>
      <ul>
          <li>A case where TAB would cycle through the wrong order with the widgets in the partition formatting window is now fixed.</li>
          <li>Installer no longer relies on HOSTNAME for determining if it is within the live environment.</li>
          <li>It is now possible to skip IPv6 configuration and adding a new user.</li>
          <li>A case where a crash happened when the swap filesystem mount path is empty is now fixed.</li>
          <li>A missing locale file is now symlinked on new grub installs. It was a harmless bug, but still needed fixing.</li>
          <li>Installer now automatically starts after booting and the other TTYs have login information if you need shell access.</li>
      </ul><br />
