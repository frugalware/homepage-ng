          The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to <a href="/news/197">announce</a> the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.4, our fourteenth stable release.<br />
          The only added feature since 1.4rc2 is LibreOffice (replaces OpenOffice.org), additionally 109 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.3 in no particular order:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Updated packages: Linux kernel 2.6.37, Xorg server 1.9, GNOME 2.32, KDE SC 4.5, Drupal 7, Python 2.7 to name a few major components.</li>
            <li>Missing koffice localization packages are back (they were missing since the integration of KDE4).</li>
            <li>New LCD font rendering available in GNOME. If you use digital video output, this will improve font appearance.</li>
            <li>OSSv4 has been added. Feel free to try it out if you have issues with ALSA.</li>
            <li>systemd is now available as an alternative of sysvinit (see <a href="http://wiki.frugalware.org/index.php/Systemd#Installation">its wiki page</a> for more info).</li>
            <li>netconfig now supports mobile 3g connections though wvdial</li>
            <li>Booting from virtio devices is now supported, as long as you use a separate /boot partition. (see <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/blog/playing-with-libvirt">here</a> for details)</li>
            <li>The GUI installer is now part of the default net/cd/dvd installer images, you don't have to download a separate image to use it.</li>
