        The Frugalware homepage is now available in Spanish and can be found
        here: <a href="http://frugalware.org/es">http://frugalware.org/es</a>.
        One of Frugalware's founding principles was that it be accessible to
        people in their native language and this is one step forward along
        that path. Many thanks to all who were involved in providing
        translations and we hope this continues for many years to come.
