      Kernel 3.6.2, which is only in current, has an ext4 data corruption bug.<br/>
      It was only recently discovered, and was not found by routine testing on<br/>
      our end. Upstream is working on a resolution, which will be pushed out to<br/>
      current as soon as they have an official fix that has made it into a new<br/>
      patch level. The bug is rare, and is reported to manifest only during two<br/>
      or more successive reboots in rapid succession. If the information is<br/>
      accurate, you should be fine if you are try to avoid this. But backup<br/>
      of important data is still the best option. For full information, please<br/>
