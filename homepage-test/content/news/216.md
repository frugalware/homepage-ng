      Dear users,<br /><br />

      I'm sorry to report that one of the important servers of the
      Frugalware infrastructure was compromised on August 25. It took
      a while to find out the details of how that was possible,
      read <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.frugalware.devel/9899">here</a>
      if you're interested.<br /><br />

      In short: we found that the attacker installed a backdoor
      similar to the one installed on kernel.org recently. We have already
      reinstalled the operating system, plus taken steps to prevent
      a similar attack in the future.<br /><br />

      On the bright side, we verified that none of the Frugalware
      Git repos nor binary packages were modified during the
      attack, so you don't have to fear that Pacman-G2 installed any
      problematic updates on your computer.<br /><br />

      Thanks for your understanding.
