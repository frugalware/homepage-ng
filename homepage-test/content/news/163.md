            The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to <a href="/news/163">announce</a> the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.2, our twelfth stable release.<br />
            No new features have been added since 1.2rc2, but 62 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.1 in no particular order:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Up to date packages: Linux kernel 2.6.32.8, GNU C library 2.11.1, Xorg 7.5, GNOME 2.28, KDE 4.3.5 to name a few major components.</li>
                                <li>KMS (Kernel Mode-Setting) is now enabled by default for Intel and Radeon cards.</li>
                <li>PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is now part of the base system.</li>
                <li>Introduced devtmpfs: you can now exclude /dev from backups, along with /proc and /sys.</li>
                                <li>Removed several large games from the install images (CD/DVD) which means one less DVD or 4 less CDs.</li>
                                <li>We finally upgraded our KDE (and related) packages to the 4.x branch. The work started back in April 2009 and now we thought it's a good move to merge that testing repository.</li>
                                <li>This release comes with Xorg 7.5, see the <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/RELNOTES.html#AEN26">upstream list of new features</a>.</li>
                                <li>We've updated our bluez userspace stack to the 4.x branch, which allowed us to improve both GNOME and KDE bluetooth support.</li>
            </ul>
