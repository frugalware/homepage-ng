      There has been an update to current in regards to systemd. During testing, there was discovered to be some issues with reboots and shutdowns appearing to 'hang'.<br/>
      Further inspection revealed that the behavior was caused by display-manager.service refusing to shutdown in a timely manner, by systemd's definition. The process<br/>
      still works out in the end, provided you wait long enough for the effected service to be forced to terminate by timeout. This is a public announcement, in the<br/>
      event you experience a 'hang' during reboot or shutdown, that you should try waiting it out. The default timeout per service is 90 seconds, so it may take awhile.<br/>
      If you want more details as to what is going on during this 'hang', you should boot without the 'splash' and 'quiet' boot arguments. Thank you.<br/>
