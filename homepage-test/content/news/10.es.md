            We are pleased to inform our Hungarian users that the HUP (Hungarian Unix Portal) made a complete forum for us, which is available <a href="http://hup.hu/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewforum&amp;f=56">here</a>.<br />
            In the near future two new things will be available in our webpage: the Wiki page and our Forum.<br />
            Besides these things, the Frugalware will widen with the slovak language. The Frugalware User Documentation is ready (can be read <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/docs/html/sk/">here</a>) in slovak language, the translation of the setup and the init system is going on now.<br />
