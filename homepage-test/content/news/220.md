        We have a new <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org">bug tracker system</a>. Flyspray is obsolete since a while and we have chosen <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a>. All reports have been imported. If you has an account with the previous bts, you must reset your password as indicated on the main page.<br /><br />
        Special thanks from Frugalware developers to Xarkam for his work!<br />
