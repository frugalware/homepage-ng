      The upgrade to GRUB2 has been merged into current recently. This upgrade will not automatically break your system,<br/>
      because it must be done manually by the user. GRUB1 will no longer be supported from now on, so you should proceed<br/>
      with the upgrade as instructed <a href="/docs/upgrade.html#_grub2_upgrade">here</a>.<br/>
